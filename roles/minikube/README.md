# Kubernetes service

To create a simple single node Kubernetes server;

* Change any of the variables in the environments/prod files, and make sure you add regions and their values.

```
./runme
```

Once the server is up there will be a simple Kubernetes application using the OpenShift Hello-Openshift container.
